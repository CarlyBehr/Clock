I've created an animated clock with the following features:

A vintage design with an orange outer ring and blue accents
Roman numerals at the quarters (XII, III, VI, IX)
Hour markers with thicker lines at the quarters
Blue hour and minute hands
An orange second hand for contrast
Real-time animation using React's useState and useEffect hooks
Responsive design that maintains aspect ratio
Serif font for the numerals to enhance the vintage feel
